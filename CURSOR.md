### ðŸ”§ Key Technical Solutions

#### Brand Account Session Issue
**Problem**: Google OAuth with YouTube Brand Accounts replaces the main user session, causing authentication confusion.

**Solution**: Two-phase authentication:
1. **Phase 1**: Basic Google sign-in with minimal scopes â†’ establishes primary user session
2. **Phase 2**: Popup-based YouTube OAuth â†’ gets YouTube tokens but associates them with the original user via `state` parameter

## Important Notes

### Authentication & Security
- **Session Preservation**: The popup-based YouTube OAuth is crucial for preventing Brand Account session takeover
- **User ID Consistency**: Always use the `state` parameter to ensure YouTube data is associated with the correct user
- **Token Management**: YouTube access/refresh tokens are stored in `google_accounts` table and can be used for API calls
- **Multi-Channel Support**: A single user can connect multiple YouTube channels (personal + Brand Accounts)

### Dashboard & Navigation
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Fixed 213px sidebar with dynamic channel routing and navigation states
- **Channel Management**: Multi-channel support with last channel tracking and seamless switching
- **Route Protection**: Automatic redirects based on authentication and channel availability
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Clear navigation paths with active state indicators

### UI/UX Features
- **Hydration Safety**: All components designed to prevent React hydration mismatch errors
- **Responsive Layout**: Sidebar + main content area with responsive breakpoints
- **Enhanced Typography**: Improved font sizing and spacing across all components
- **Animation System**: Character-by-character text animation with enhanced batch processing
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover states, loading indicators, and micro-interactions throughout

### Analytics Integration
- **Real-Time Data**: Live YouTube Analytics API integration with automatic token refresh
- **Performance Metrics**: Subscriber growth, view counts, engagement rates, watch time
- **Date Range Analysis**: 90-day analytics with customizable time periods
- **Channel Insights**: Account age calculation, publishing frequency, content performance

### Animation System
- **Batch-Based Animation**: Text appears in 2-sentence chunks with 3-second pauses between batches
- **Punctuation Timing**: 1-second pause after sentence endings, 0.5-second pause after commas (except in numbers)
- **Character Filtering**: Automatically removes problematic Unicode characters and replacement symbols
- **Fade Transitions**: Smooth 0.5-second fade-out between text batches

### Performance Considerations
- **Animation Optimization**: Uses CSS transforms and will-change for smooth performance
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of timers and animation delays
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading during hydration to prevent layout shifts

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Authentication Issues
1. **"invalid_client" error**: Check Google Client ID/Secret in environment variables
2. **"redirect_uri_mismatch"**: Ensure redirect URIs in code match Google Console exactly
3. **Session replacement**: Use popup-based OAuth for secondary authentications
4. **Port conflicts**: App runs on localhost:3001 (port 3000 often in use)

### React & Hydration Issues
1. **Hydration mismatch**: Ensure server and client render identical content initially. Use loading states during hydration.
2. **Unicode replacement characters**: The app automatically filters problematic Unicode characters from AI responses
3. **Animation timing issues**: Character animation uses cumulative delays with punctuation pauses for natural timing

### UI/UX Issues
1. **No scrollbars**: Layout uses fixed header/footer with flex-1 main content for full-height design
2. **Text animation not working**: Ensure `animate-heroChar` CSS class is properly defined and characters have `data-char` attributes
3. **Responsive text issues**: Text sizing uses Tailwind responsive classes (`text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl`)

## Neria Chat System & Context Memory Management

### Server-side context and memory
- **Pinned context assembly** (on `POST /api/neria/chat`):
  - **Channel meta**: title and external YouTube id from `channels` via the thread's `channel_id`.
  - **Memory profile**: long-term user+channel memory from `memory_profile` (goals, preferences, constraints).
  - **Latest stats**: summary from `stats_snapshots` for period `latest`, falling back to `latest_video_snapshots` if needed.
  - **Channel context**: `neria_context` rows for `channel_about` and `recent_video_titles` (parsed JSON list).
  - **Strategy plan**: persisted coaching plan from `channel_strategy.plan_text`.
  - These are merged into a single system prompt to ground replies in goals, constraints, channel context and current stats.
- **Conversation history**: last 12 messages from `chat_messages` are included to preserve short-term context while controlling token usage.
- **Storage**: user messages and assistant replies are appended to `chat_messages` under the thread.
- **Summarization**: if a thread exceeds 30 messages, a compact summary is generated and stored in `thread_summaries` to aid long-term recall without sending the entire history.
- **Thread resolution**: threads are looked up/created per user and optionally per channel (`chat_threads`), accepting either internal channel UUID or external YouTube `channel_id`.
- **Auth & access control**: all routes require an authenticated Supabase user; message/thread reads validate ownership.

### Dashboard chat window integration
- **Where it renders**: `components/DashboardLayout.tsx` and `components/ClientDashboardLayout.tsx` include `NeriaContainer`, so the chat is available across dashboard pages.
- **Thread restoration**: on channel change/mount, `NeriaContainer` restores the last thread id from `localStorage` key `neria:lastThread:{channelId}`; if missing, it fetches the most recent thread for that channel via `GET /api/neria/threads?channelId=...`.
- **History loading**: messages are loaded via `GET /api/neria/messages?threadId=...` and shown in the window.
- **Send flow**: messages are optimistically added in the UI, then `POST /api/neria/chat` is called with `{ channelId, threadId, message }`. The response streams in real-time using Server-Sent Events, with text appearing character-by-character as generated. The `threadId` is persisted if newly created.
- **Per-channel memory**: last thread id is persisted per channel in `localStorage`, enabling seamless continuity as users navigate dashboard pages for the same channel.
- **UI behavior**: the chat window can be minimized or detached into a floating, draggable/resizable panel; state is managed via `NeriaContext` and component state.

### AI Intent Detection & Action System
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Advanced AI-powered system that analyzes user requests to determine appropriate actions, replacing brittle keyword matching with robust intent recognition
- **Action Types**: Supports multiple intent categories including `generate_video_titles`, `navigate_to_planner`, `navigate_to_goals`, `navigate_to_analytics`, `chat_only`, and extensible `other` actions
- **Smart Redirect Logic**: AI determines not only what action to take but whether navigation is needed and where to redirect based on current page context
- **Extensible Architecture**: Built for future expansion to handle additional app actions and navigation patterns as the platform grows
- **Context Awareness**: Intent analysis considers both the user's message and their current location in the app to make intelligent routing decisions

### Database Maintenance & Schema Compliance

**IMPORTANT: Whenever using the Supabase MCP server to examine the database schema, always verify and update the "wipe all data" API to ensure it includes all user-specific tables.**

**Automated Maintenance Instructions:**
1. **Schema Check**: When using `mcp_supabase_list_tables` to examine the database, compare the results against the tables deleted in `/api/wipe-all-data/route.ts`
2. **Required Action**: If any user-specific tables are missing from the wipe API, immediately update it to include those tables
3. **Table Categories to Include**:
   - All tables with `user_id` foreign keys
   - All tables with `channel_id` foreign keys (since channels belong to users)
   - Chat-related tables (`chat_threads`, `chat_messages`, `thread_summaries`)
   - User-generated content tables (`video_planner_ideas`, `memory_profile`, etc.)
4. **Tables to Exclude**: System tables (`model_settings`, `model_providers`, `temp_sync_data`)
5. **Update Pattern**: Add new table deletions in the channel-related section if they have `channel_id`, or in the user-specific section if they only have `user_id`

**Current Tables Included in Wipe API:** `neria_context`, `latest_video_snapshots`, `stats_snapshots`, `memory_profile`, `channel_strategy`, `channel_questions`, `collection_chunks`, `memory_longterm`, `video_planner_ideas`, `chat_messages`, `thread_summaries`, `chat_threads`, `channels`, `google_accounts`
